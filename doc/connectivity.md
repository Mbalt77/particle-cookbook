# Connectivity
Connectivity is at the heart of the Particle family of devices. Whether or 
not you are using the Particle Cloud platform, the main advantage of these
devices is their built-in, easy-to-use ability to communicate, whether by
WiFi/Ethernet, Bluetooth, or Mesh protocols.

Particle provides a lot of control over how devices use that connectivity,
which makes this a very broad subject.

## ?? MQTT ??
\[Maybe include info about MQTT here? But there might be a better parent 
topic for it later.\]
